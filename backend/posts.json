The Federer Express tram celebrates the 20-time Grand Slam winner with photos of some of his most iconic moments sprawled on the outside, while the inside features facts and information about the Swiss Star and some of the seats are reminiscent of chairs that can be found on the side of a court during a changeover.\n\n\"The project was very important to me. That is why it is a great honor for me to be able to see the tram on the streets of Basel in the future,\" said Roger.\n\n","image":"https://www.rogerfederer.com/images/BVB-Roger-Federer-Tram-009.jpg","date":"2023-12-08"}]}
